# Gyro3dMonitor

This application is a **Windows program that receives sensor data from the MPU6050 gyroscope connected to a Raspberry Pi, reflects it in the posture of a 3D model, and displays it in real time**.  
The 3D model can be loaded from an STL file, allowing you to freely choose and display your favorite models.
The display language is also supported: Japanese, English, Spanish, and Korean.
